## üìñ Introduction

In computer networks, **routing** is the process of selecting the best path for data to travel from source to destination.  
**Routing protocols** help routers dynamically learn, share, and update information about network paths.

---

## üß≠ What Is a Routing Protocol?

A **routing protocol** is a set of rules used by routers to communicate with each other, exchange routing information, and determine the **best path** for forwarding packets.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Types of Routing

### 1. Static Routing

- Routes are **manually configured** by a network administrator.
- **No automatic updates**.
- Simple, but not scalable.

### 2. Dynamic Routing

- Routers **automatically discover and maintain routes** using routing protocols.
- Adapts to network changes.
- Ideal for **large and complex networks**.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Classification of Routing Protocols

### 1. Distance Vector Routing Protocols

- Use **hop count** to determine the best path.
- Routers **periodically broadcast** their entire routing table.
- **Slow convergence**, risk of **routing loops**.

üîπ Examples:
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**
- **IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**

---

### 2. Link State Routing Protocols

- Build a **complete map of the network** (topology).
- Use **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** to calculate the shortest path.
- **Faster convergence**, more scalable and accurate.

üîπ Examples:
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**
- **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)**

---

### 3. Hybrid Routing Protocols

- Combine features of **distance vector** and **link-state** protocols.
- Efficient and scalable.

üîπ Example:
- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**

---

## üåç Interior vs Exterior Routing Protocols

| Type | Description | Protocols |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)** | Used within a single autonomous system (AS) | RIP, OSPF, EIGRP |
| **EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)** | Used to exchange routing info between different ASes | **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** |

---

## üö¶ Popular Routing Protocols

| Protocol | Type | Algorithm | Key Features |
|----------|------|-----------|--------------|
| **RIP** | Distance Vector | Bellman-Ford | Max 15 hops, simple, legacy |
| **IGRP** | Distance Vector | Cisco proprietary | Supports multiple metrics |
| **EIGRP** | Hybrid | Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) | Fast convergence, Cisco proprietary |
| **OSPF** | Link-State | Dijkstra (SPF) | Open standard, supports areas |
| **IS-IS** | Link-State | Dijkstra | Used in large ISPs |
| **BGP** | Path Vector (EGP) | Best Path Selection | Used on the Internet, scalable |

| Type          | IGP       | IGP       | IGP       | EGP        |
| Algorithm     | Distance Vector | Link State | Hybrid     | Path Vector |
| Metric        | Hop Count | Cost      | Bandwidth, delay, etc. | Path attributes |
| Max Hops      | 15        | Unlimited | 224       | Unlimited  |
| Convergence   | Slow      | Fast      | Very Fast | Slow       |
| Scalability   | Low       | High      | Medium    | Very High  |
| Open Standard | Yes       | Yes       | No (Cisco) | Yes        |

## üìè Routing Metrics

Routing decisions are often based on **metrics**, including:

- **Hop count**
- **Bandwidth**
- **Delay (latency)**
- **Load**
- **Reliability**
- **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)**
- **Cost (in OSPF)**

---

## üî¢ Administrative Distance (AD)

**Administrative Distance** = trustworthiness of a routing source (lower = more trusted)

| Source           | AD Value |
|------------------|----------|
| Connected route  | 0        |
| Static route     | 1        |
| EIGRP            | 90       |
| OSPF             | 110      |
| RIP              | 120      |
| External BGP     | 20       |
| Internal BGP     | 200      |
| Unknown          | 255 (invalid) |

## ‚ùì FAQs

### Q1: Why not use only static routing?

- Static routing doesn't adapt to changes (e.g., link failures).
- It's hard to manage in large networks.

### Q2: What happens if multiple protocols offer a route?

- The router chooses the route with the **lowest AD**.

### Q3: Can I use multiple routing protocols together?

- ‚úÖ Yes, but you must manage **route redistribution** carefully.

### Q4: Is BGP used in private networks?

- Not commonly. BGP is mainly for **Internet-scale** routing between ISPs.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Routing protocols are essential to ensure data finds the most efficient and reliable path across networks.  
They dynamically adapt to changes, reduce administrative burden, and scale to support modern enterprise and Internet infrastructure.

üéØ **In summary:**

- Use **IGPs (like OSPF/EIGRP)** within your organization.
- Use **BGP** for communication between ISPs or large-scale networks.
- Understand **metrics**, **AD**, and **routing types** to optimize performance and security.
