## üìñ Introduction

**Remote Access** allows users and administrators to connect to systems and networks from a different location ‚Äî often over the internet or a private WAN.

---

## üåê What Is Remote Access?

Remote Access is the ability to **connect to and control a computer or network service from another location**, without being physically present.

---

## üöÄ Why Remote Access Is Important

- Enables **remote work** and **remote troubleshooting**  
- Reduces on-site visits  
- Allows **centralized network management**  
- Crucial for **emergency access**, especially in global or distributed teams

---

## üîå Common Remote Access Protocols

### 1. Telnet  
- **Port**: 23  
- **Function**: Remote command-line access  
- **Unsecured** (transmits data in plaintext)  
- Mostly replaced by SSH for security reasons

---

### 2. SSH (Secure Shell)  
- **Port**: 22  
- Encrypted remote shell access  
- Used for **server administration**, **file transfer (SCP/SFTP)**  
- Preferred over Telnet due to **strong encryption**

---

### 3. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)  
- **Port**: 3389  
- Developed by Microsoft  
- Provides **GUI-based remote access** to Windows desktops and servers  
- Common in enterprise environments

---

### 4. VNC (Virtual Network Computing)  
- **Ports**: 5900+  
- Cross-platform, graphical desktop-sharing system  
- Requires client + server apps (e.g., RealVNC, TightVNC)  
- Slower than RDP but works across OS types

---

### 5. VPN (Virtual Private Network)  
- **Common Ports**:  
  - PPTP (1723)  
  - L2TP (1701)  
  - OpenVPN (1194)  
- Creates a **secure encrypted tunnel** for remote access to a private network  
- Ensures **confidentiality** and **integrity** of transmitted data

---

### 6. FTP/SFTP  
- FTP: Port **21**  
- SFTP (Secure FTP): Port **22**  
- Used for **remote file transfer**  
- SFTP uses **SSH for encryption**, FTP does not

---

### 7. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)  
- **Port**: 161  
- Used for **remote monitoring** and management of network devices  
- SNMPv3 offers **authentication and encryption**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Remote Access Services

### 1. Remote Desktop Services (Windows)  
- Built-in feature in **Windows Server**  
- Supports **multiple user sessions**, **RemoteApp**, and **Gateway services**

### 2. TeamViewer, AnyDesk, etc.  
- Third-party remote access tools  
- Easy to use, cross-platform  
- Secure, encrypted sessions with GUI  
- Useful for **IT support**, **collaboration**, or **remote teaching**

### 3. Cloud-Based Access (Remote Management Portals)  
- Example: **Cisco Meraki**, **AWS Systems Manager**, **Google Admin**  
- Allows **remote config, monitoring**, and **policy enforcement**
